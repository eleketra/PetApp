# PetApp
App to manage the pet available in the store. This core of the app is to learn how to access database.


The app is a part of my learning. I have done the free course from udacity Android Basics: Data Storage.
A great start for the learning. They have prepared the course using the java for Application Development.
But I have tried to develop the same app using the kotlin.All the features are same except the language used for the 
development.

The app has two parts- one where you list all the pets and their details and second where you can add new pet or edit the details 
of the existing pet. The main purpose of the app is to learn how to create , connect , store , modify and access the database.
