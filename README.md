# PetApp
App to manage the pet available in the store. This core of the app is to learn how to access database.


The app is a part of my learning. I have done the free course from udacity Android Basics: Data Storage.
A great start for the learning. They have prepared the course using the java for Application Development.
But I have tried to develop the same app using the kotlin.All the features are same except the language used for the 
development.
